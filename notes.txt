Look to implement generics logic with get location data and get locations functions. essentially same logic.

Things to work on:
- function logic and O(n) efficiencies.
- naming conventions
- code organization
- Concurrency efficiencies in function logic (channels, mutex)
- Use of interfaces, generics
- Fancier error handling techniques
- Testing in go (failing early. t.errorf, t.fatal("err msg")). failing early if err is nil.
